# Alturos.ImageAnnotation

The purpose of this project is to manage training data for Neural Networks. The data is stored at a central location, for example Amazon S3.
In our case we have image data for different runs that we want to annotate together. Every run is stored in an AnnotationPackage.
For every AnnotationPackage you can set your own tags... this information is stored in the Amazon DynamoDB.

## Features

 - Collaborative annotation of images
 - Verification of image annotation data
 - Export for yolo (train.txt, test.txt, obj.names) with filters
 - No requirement for a custom server

## Data preperation

If you have a video file and need the individual frames you can use [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org) to extract the images. This command exports every 10th frame in the video.
`ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf "select=not(mod(n\,10))" -vsync vfr 1_every_10/img_%03d.jpg`
